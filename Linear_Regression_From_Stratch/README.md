The goal of this lab was to familiarize myself with building a machine learning model from scratch. In this lab I create three functions to do Simple Linear Regression: 

- One that takes in a vector of x values and a vector of y values and returns the line of best fit
- Another that predicts y values based on the line of best fit I calculated
- A final function that calculates the R Squared of the line

I then compared all my results to the results given by the Linear Regression model in skLearn. My functions produced similar results to the skLearn model.
